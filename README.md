# Shiny-Dashboard-Template
I have seen a ton of examples for either [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) or [Shiny Dashboard](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/) apps 
with all of the code living in either one file, or two files (ui and server).
I personally like to compartmentalize my code in a way that's manageable, and easy to break out or re-use.

**With that being said**, I created this repo to serve as a template for Shiny Dashboard apps. Really basic, nothing crazy, simplistic file structure. If there is anything I missed, feel free to create a pr :) Like I said, this is a template/boilerplate. 

Test this is working
